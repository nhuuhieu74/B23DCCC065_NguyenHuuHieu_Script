    <h1 style="color:red"> <b> The middle-income trap has little evidence going for it </b> </h1>
    <p> EVERY FEW YEARS Foreign Affairs, a magazine about international relations, provokes a fracas in a neighbouring discipline, 
        international economics. In 1994 it published an essay by Paul Krugman, “The Myth of Asia’s Miracle”, which re-examined the source of the tigers’ 
        success. Then, after the Asian financial crisis, it came up with “The Capital Myth” by Jagdish Bhagwati,
        which re-examined the case for free capital flows, the source of the tigers’ humiliation. 
        In 2004 it offered “Globalisation’s Missing Middle” by Geoffrey Garrett, then at the University of California, Los Angeles.
         This essay is cited much less often than the other two, but in a roundabout way it has been equally influential.
          It argued that middle-ranked countries were in a bind, unable to compete either with the cutting-edge technology of rich nations or 
          the cut-throat prices of poor ones. “Middle-income countries”, it said, “have not done nearly as well under globalised markets as either richer or 
          poorer countries.” </p>

        <p><i></i> The statistical work by Messrs Eichengreen, Park and Shin shows that middle-income countries do suffer slowdowns. 
            But since it looks only at countries with an income per person of over $10,000, it cannot say whether they are more 
            vulnerable to such setbacks than poor countries. That was not a question the authors ever intended to answer. 
            When their method is extended 
            to countries further down the income scale, it turns out that slowdowns among poorer economies are 
            at least as prevalent as among middle-income ones.
